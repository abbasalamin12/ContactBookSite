# ContactBookSite
A contact book site built using Python, Django, SQLite, HTML, and CSS.

I used Python 3.9.5 for this, and I installed the following pip packages:
- django
- djangorestframework
- markdown
- django-filter
- requests

Instructions:

When you have all the packages installed. Go to the ContactBookSite/ContactBookSite directory in the command line, and type 'python manage.py runserver' to run the site. Control+Click the development server link that comes up in the command line, and it should open the site. The main page is where the contacts are listed, you can click on the 'Add Contact' button/link to add new contacts. You can edit/delete contacts using the buttons next to them in the list.
